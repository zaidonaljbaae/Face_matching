# Face_matching
This project implements a face landmark detection and comparison system using OpenCV and Dlib libraries. The primary goal is to extract facial landmarks from images and determine if two faces match based on their landmark positions.

# Features
Facial Landmark Extraction: Detects and visualizes 68 facial landmarks on input images.
Face Cropping: Extracts the face region from the input images for further processing.
Delaunay Triangulation: Performs triangulation on detected landmarks to visualize the facial structure.
Distance Calculation: Computes the average distance between landmarks of two faces to assess similarity.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Dlib
